# Spooky Ghostwriter Comics

It's a Sentinels of the Multiverse mod.

## Installation

Download the main folder to Steam\steamapps\common\Sentinels of the Multiverse\mods

## Includes

* Escarlata (Hero)
* Gold Dragon (Hero)
* Tsukiko (Hero)
* Electrogeist (Hero)
* The Alesia Circus (Environment)

## Status

* Gold Dragon and Escarlata are fully implemented, with all of their cutouts.
* Tsukiko has cutouts, but no card art yet. She is mostly finished playtesting, but may be buggy.
* Electrogeist has no art yet, and is currently in playtesting. He may be buggy.
* The Alesia Circus is functional but has no art other than the card back.

## Known Issues

* Ember Cloak's 'destroy to absorb fire damage' effect may not react properly if the damage could have been redirected - Escarlata may still regain HP, but takes the damage anyway. This is probably a timing issue that will be easier to clear up with future documentation.

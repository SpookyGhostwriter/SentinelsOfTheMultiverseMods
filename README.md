It's a Sentinels of the Multiverse mod.

## Installation

Download the main folder to Steam\steamapps\common\Sentinels of the Multiverse\mods

## Includes

* Escarlata (Hero)
* Gold Dragon (Hero)
* The Alesia Circus (Environment)

## Status

* Escarlata and her Firedancer variant are fully implemented.
* "The Enraged Escarlata" variant is functional, but missing incapacitated card art and most of its cutouts.
* Gold Dragon is functional and has full card art, but only a few cutouts.
* The Alesia Circus is functional but has no art other than the card back.

## Known Issues

* When Gold Dragon's orbs ask to change damage types, they don't show a specific message. They simply ask "Yes or no?". This is an engine limitation that Handelabra is aware of.
* Ember Cloak's 'destroy to absorb fire damage' effect may not react properly if the damage could have been redirected - Escarlata may still regain HP, but takes the damage anyway. This is probably a timing issue that will be easier to clear up with future documentation.

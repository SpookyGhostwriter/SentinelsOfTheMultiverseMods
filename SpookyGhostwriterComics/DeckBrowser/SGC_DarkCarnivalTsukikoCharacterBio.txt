In an alternate Universe, one much edgier and much more eager to jump on the trends of the 90s, there exists a darker version of the Alesia Circus. In this woefully unsuccessful attempt at rebooting a franchise, Vercingetorix puts his performers in actual danger, and the only way to survive was for Tsukiko to move beyond stage magic and learn actual magic.

The Dark Carnival has since been retconned away as just a dream or everyone was actually robots or something.

The Alesia Circus is the pride and joy of its founder, a man known only as Vercingetorix. He spent many years travelling the world, looking for people whose acts seemed truly impossible. He succeeded.

There are six star acts in Alesia:

{ Stiletto, a knife-thrower with unparalleled accuracy
{ Ravindra, a fire-breather who can seemingly move the fire he breathes at will
{ Henry, a mime whose illusions trick a viewer's mind into thinking his walls are real
{ Pierre, a lion tamer who takes care of Heir and Reign, two ghost lions
{ Miss Isle, a clown who juggles explosives
{ Tsukiko, a stage magician who has inherited and mastered a set of superpowered clothing

If their acts seem like they could be suited for combat, there's a good reason. Until recently, The Alesia Circus was stuck in a war against vicious dryads. But now, the circus is ready for peaceful days. All are welcome to play some fun carnival games, win tickets, and watch incredible shows.

Lots of heroes see their abilities and responsibilities as a curse, and Tyson Morin doesn't understand why. When he was a teenager, an ancient family heirloom infused him with the power of a dragon, and he's never been happier. 

Not only did his strength, speed and vitality become all but superhuman, he gained the ability to transform into a golden dragon. This was his family's destiny - the gift given to the first of each generation to touch the statue. With this newfound power, Tyson became a superhero. 

After saving New Granwall City a few times, Gold Dragon quickly became a celebrity. Not shy of his new celebrity status, Tyson eagerly marketed his image and made a fortune in Gold Dragon action figures, book deals, films, and anything else he could put his face on. 

Happy to use (a portion of) his newfound wealth for the greater good, Gold Dragon helped fund the New Granwall City Hero Agency, which would later support the New Granwall Guardians. Gold Dragon was one of the founding members of this new organization, which aimed to defend New Granwall City and the surrounding regions from the strangely numerous and varied threats it faced.

Rich, famous, handsome, noble, and occasionally a 700-pound flying reptile, Tyson Morin lives the high life and loves every minute of it.

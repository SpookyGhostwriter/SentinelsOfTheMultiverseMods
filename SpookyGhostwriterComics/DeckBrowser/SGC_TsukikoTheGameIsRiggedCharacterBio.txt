Looking for more ways to use her abilities, Tsukiko took a break from the Alesia Circus and joined a casino. There, she became a popular dealer. She dazzled the casino's patrons with fancy shuffling, parlour tricks and her stage-presence-turned-charisma.

For months, Tsukiko enjoyed the high life. She stayed in lavish hotels, not a cramped circus trailer. She took gigs on cruise ships, not tents in a field. She ate caviar, not caramel corn. Tsukiko had only intended to take a break from the circus life, but why not stay in the casino business forever?

Then, one day, as she performed her normal card tricks for the gamblers, a hand caught her wrist. It was Vercingetorix, manager of the Alesia Circus, having come to check on her. For the first time ever, he'd seen through one of her tricks. Suddenly, Tsukiko realized how much of her skill she'd lost, and quit on the spot. Tsukiko returned to the Alesia Circus. Though she had some fond memories of her life as a casino dealer, she knew that the circus was where she truly belonged.

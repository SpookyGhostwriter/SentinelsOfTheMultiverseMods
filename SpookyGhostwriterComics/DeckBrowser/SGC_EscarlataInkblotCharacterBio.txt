Escarlata was not a particularly nuanced character in the 1920s cartoon. Her main - and arguably only - character trait was 'angry'. Her short fuse caused her to rage over nearly anything, from Gold Dragon's unsuccessful attempts at romance to Tsukiko's irritating magic tricks.

Though many problems were caused by Escarlata's temper, just as many episodes had her defeat the weekly bad guy - in the needlessly violent ways that only old cartoons could get away with. Sometimes, she even defeated the bad guy on purpose!

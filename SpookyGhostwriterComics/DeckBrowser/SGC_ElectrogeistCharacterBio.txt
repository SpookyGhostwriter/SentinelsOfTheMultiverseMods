Martin Cypher was only 14 when he was struck by a bolt of lightning. Though he made a full recovery, Martin was left with a massive fractal scar over most of his body and a strange ability to affect electronics. Martin's new powers came to him naturally - soon, controlling electronic devices and even making his own bolts of electricity was as easy as moving a finger.

Still young, Martin became the sidekick of a superhero known as Geist. There, along with fellow sidekick Erisa Reynolds, he learned the ins and outs of crime-fighting. His original superhero alias was Electro, but after Geist retired and passed the torch to his sidekicks, he became Electrogeist - one of the earliest members of the New Granwall Guardians.

Much later, Electrogeist worked alongside Escarlata to take down the villainess Vex. In exchange for a reduced sentence, Vex offered to use her robotic mastery to create gadgets for the New Granwall Guardians. This was how Electrogeist received Excalibolt: a puppet-like "ghost" robot that he could control with his powers. The bot quickly became his signature tool, both in and out of combat.

Electrogeist may not be the most well-known of the Guardians, but he's a silver bullet against gadget-focused villains, a valuable tactician, and a capable fighter alongside his robotic ghost.

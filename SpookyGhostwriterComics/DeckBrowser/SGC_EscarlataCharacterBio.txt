Even as a child, when Cassandra had her heart set on something, she refused to let anything stop her. She'd follow her heart rather than do as she was told, and devote herself fully to the cause, no matter what it was. A need to express her strong emotions led her to practice art, which quickly became one of her biggest obsessions.

Though she didn't know it at the time, Cassandra's passion for art would lead her down the path of a superhero. During a school trip to a museum, an ancient phoenix statue resonated with her. Signs around the statue clearly stated "DO NOT TOUCH", though Cassandra naturally ignored those and touched the statue. A few days later, she began to feel unnaturally warm.

Cassandra developed a fever, never realizing it had anything to do with the statue. The fever began as a mild heat, but built over the course of weeks and months until she was hospitalized. No doctor could diagnose her sickness, and no treatment slowed down the increasing heat. Cassandra simply got warmer and warmer until her body couldn't handle the heat. At the age of 13, Cassandra died.

However, the ever-stubborn Cassandra refused to even let death stop her. In the words of her friends and family, she willed herself back to life and beat the fever into submission. Now in control of the intense heat that took her life, Cassandra found she had the ability to conjure flames.

Years later, Cassandra moved to New Granwall City and joined the world-reknowned group of heroes, the New Granwall Guardians under the name Escarlata. It didn't take her long to build a reputation as a fearless warrior who simply will not give up, always leaping into insurmountable odds and somehow getting the job done. What's a criminal to a woman who has already defeated death itself?

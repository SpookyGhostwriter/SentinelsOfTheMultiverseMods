Tsukiko performed her first magic trick at the age of four, and never stopped. She learned everything she could about stage magic, mastering every trick she came across, and performed small-scale shows in her home town.

Looking to turn her passion into a career, Tsukiko (plus her best friend / lovely assistant Galen) contacted the Alesia Circus. The manager of Alesia, a man named Vercingetorix, told Tsukiko and Galen that they were skilled enough to join, but warned them that Alesia was locked in a life-or-death battle against plant monsters called dryads.

Tsukiko and Galen refused the offer, deciding that Vercingetorix was crazy. Vercingetorix accepted their decision, but gave them a token of appreciation anyway - a camo-patterned tank top that Alesia's former magician used to use in her shows.

At Tsukiko and Galen's next show, dryads attacked, and Vercingetorix instructed Tsukiko on how to use the outfit he'd given her. The tank top transformed around her into an actual tank, letting her defeat the monsters and save everybody. Tsukiko and Galen joined the circus, eager to hone their skills in both stage magic and combat.

Long after the battle with the dryads, the Alesia Circus travelled to New Granwall City. Tsukiko would rather perform magic shows than fight, but when the New Granwall Guardians need her, she's always willing to pick up her sword and fancy clothing once more...
